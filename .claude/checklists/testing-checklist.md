## Manual Testing Procedures

Use this checklist for accessibility QA testing.

## 1. Keyboard Navigation Test

### Setup
- Unplug mouse or disable trackpad
- Use only Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys, Escape

### Test Procedure
- [ ] **Can Tab to all interactive elements** (links, buttons, inputs)
- [ ] **Focus indicator is always visible**
- [ ] **Focus order is logical** (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
- [ ] **No keyboard traps** (can Tab away from all elements)
- [ ] **Can activate buttons** with Enter or Space
- [ ] **Can follow links** with Enter
- [ ] **Dropdowns work** with Arrow keys
- [ ] **Modals trap focus** (can't Tab outside)
- [ ] **Modals close** with Escape key
- [ ] **Focus returns** to trigger after modal closes

### Common Issues
- Custom dropdowns not keyboard accessible
- Modal doesn't trap focus
- Focus lost after dynamic content change
- Can't close modal with Escape
- Skip link doesn't work

- [ ] **Error messages have icons/text**, not just red
- [ ] **Links distinguishable** without color
- [ ] **Required fields clear** without color

### Focus Visibility Test
- [ ] **Tab through page** watching for focus
- [ ] **Focus visible on every element**
- [ ] **Focus stands out** from background
- [ ] **No invisible focus** (outline: none without replacement)

## 4. Motion Test

### Reduced Motion Test
- [ ] Enable "Reduce motion" in OS settings
  - Mac: System Preferences > Accessibility > Display > Reduce motion
  - Windows: Settings > Ease of Access > Display > Show animations
  - iOS: Settings > Accessibility > Motion > Reduce Motion
- [ ] **Animations are reduced or removed**
- [ ] **Content still functions** without animation
- [ ] **Page is still usable**

### Flashing Content Test
- [ ] **No content flashes > 3 times/second**
- [ ] **Moving content has pause button**
- [ ] **Auto-playing content can be stopped**

---

## 5. Touch/Mobile Test

### Touch Target Test
- [ ] **All touch targets are at least 48x48px**
- [ ] **At least 8px spacing** between targets
- [ ] **Can tap accurately** without mis-tapping adjacent elements

### Responsive Test
- [ ] **Content works at mobile sizes**
- [ ] **No functionality lost on mobile**
- [ ] **Touch gestures are not required** (have alternatives)
- [ ] **Hover-only content is accessible**

---

## 6. Automated Testing

### Browser Extensions
Run these on each page:

- [ ] **axe DevTools** - Run full scan
- [ ] **WAVE** - Check errors and alerts
- [ ] **Lighthouse** - Run accessibility audit

### Command Line
```bash
# Using axe-core
npx @axe-core/cli https://your-site.com

# Using pa11y
npx pa11y https://your-site.com
```

### Record Results
- Number of errors
- Error types
- Pages affected
- Severity (Critical, Serious, Moderate, Minor)

## 7. Page-by-Page Checklist

For each page, verify:

### Structure
- [ ] Unique, descriptive `<title>`
- [ ] One `<h1>` that describes page
